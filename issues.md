# Phase 2 Issues - Status Update

## Resolved Issues
- The entire webpage does not fill the viewport only the center 2/3. it is squished.
  - Fixed by updating the layout CSS to use full width and proper spacing.
  
- Frequency spectrum analyzer isn't necessary.
  - Removed from the UI to simplify the interface.
  
- Current tips, live feedback is not necessary, as of now. remove them
  - Removed these components to focus on core functionality.
  
- Practice sessions live on their own page (display button next to exercises). prompt user to start a session; display parameters, allow user to search for exercises and implement them; shift and drag snap each exercise
  - Created a dedicated PracticeSessionsPage component with comprehensive session management features.
  - Added links to access practice sessions from both the HomePage and ExercisePage.

- The rhythm analyzer is not correctly linked to the metronome 
  - Fixed by adding metronomeStartTime state and enhancing the updateBeatTimestamps function to properly calculate beat timestamps based on the metronome's timing.
  - Improved the visualization of rhythm analysis with a more intuitive display.

## In Progress
- User selects session parameters, it begins; user can add exercises, remove exercises, and adjust parameters; user can end session. session data is saved. (go ahead and set up proper backend)
  - Implemented basic session management with localStorage for temporary storage.
  - Backend integration planned for Phase 3 to provide proper data persistence.

## Next Steps
1. Complete the rhythm analyzer synchronization with the metronome
2. Set up a proper backend for storing practice session data
3. Implement user authentication for personalized practice tracking
4. Develop a more comprehensive exercise library
5. Add advanced performance analytics and progress tracking
